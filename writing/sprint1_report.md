## Sprint Planning

Overall, each member plans to spend about 8-10 hours each week on this project; including about 4.5 hours of class time, an hour for completing practicals, as well as our team meetings. For the first sprint, we plan to spend the majority of our remaining time developing an example plugin. Specifically, we will be doing research into how SheetShuttle currently interacts with Google Sheets and pulls the information. This will allow us to learn more about how we will connect the information to GitHub. We will also be talking with the Computer Science department faculty about how GitHub connectivity in code will work, how it fetches data, how we would maintain the plugin, how we will deploy to GitHub, how to run tests for this program (if we need to in the first place), whether the code should utilize a csv file.

## Scrum Meetings

TODO: Please provide answers to the three stand-up meeting questions from each team member.

### Stand-Up Meeting One (10/27/2022)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Nic Ingerson
- As there was no previous meeting, no tasks have been done yet; however, I have looked into the source code for SheetShuttle to see how we may need to utilize it in our plugin.
- Before our next meeting, I will be doing research into how SheetShuttle communicates with Google Sheets and determine whether we can use a similar approach to communicate with GitHub Classroom.
- Currently, there are no obstacles in my way.

### Stand-Up Meeting Two (11/1/2022)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Nic Ingerson
- Since the last stand-up meeting, I have done research into how SheetShuttle currently communicates with GitHub Classroom and Google Sheets.
- Before our next meeting, I plan to fully understand the files that we will be utilizing when writing the program. Further, I plan to learn how to read in data from a Google Sheet.
- Currently, finding a way to pull the Google Sheet directly as opposed to using the downloaded sheet is the greatest challenge that I have faced.

### Stand-Up Meeting Three (Date)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

### Stand-Up Meeting Four (Date)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

### Stand-Up Meeting Five (Date)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

## Sprint Review and Retrospective

### Sprint review

We had two issues to work with for this first sprint which served as research. We looked into Google API access as well as OBC's project GradeAlert. There were no tasks that were not completed as all of the goals we set for ourselves were achieved. We implemented direct Google Sheets access.

### Summary of sprint retrospective

As a team, we did relatively well with completing the tasks we set out to complete, but for the next sprint, I think we need to work on communication.
