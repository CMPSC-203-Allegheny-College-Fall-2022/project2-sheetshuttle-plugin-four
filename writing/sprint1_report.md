## Sprint Planning

Overall, each member plans to spend about 8-10 hours each week on this project; including about 4.5 hours of class time, an
hour for completing practicals, as well as our team meetings. For the first sprint, we plan to spend the majority of our
remaining time developing an example plugin. Specifically, we will be doing research into how SheetShuttle currently
interacts with Google Sheets and pulls the information. This will allow us to learn more about how we will connect the
information to GitHub. We will also be talking with the Computer Science department faculty about how GitHub connectivity in
code will work, how it fetches data, how we would maintain the plugin, how we will deploy to GitHub, how to run tests for
this program (if we need to in the first place), whether the code should utilize a csv file.

## Scrum Meetings

Please provide answers to the three stand-up meeting questions from each team member.

### Stand-Up Meeting One (10/27/2022)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Nic Ingerson

- As there was no previous meeting, no tasks have been done yet; however, I have looked into the source code for SheetShuttle to see how we may need to utilize it in our plugin.
- Before our next meeting, I will be doing research into how SheetShuttle communicates with Google Sheets and determine whether we can use a similar approach to communicate with GitHub Classroom.
- Currently, there are no obstacles in my way.

Bill Ochieng

-> I was looking at how the grading tool that is almost similar to how our project works and this was prompting me to have a meeting with one other member of our group, where we met with the faculty that owns the grading tool and just got an insight of how the functionality of his tool works and the meeting was helpful, opening our eyes to different approaches to our task.
-> As I prepare for the next meeting i'm diving into sheet shuttle and trying to see how we can implement a plug in a markdown.
-> Scheduling a meeting with Noor, just for office hours in places where I feel I have a challenge.

Brock Brumfield

- There was no meeting before this but have looked into some fo the code and started to try and comprehend it.
- Before the next meeting, I will fill out my issue, and continue todo research. I will also try to understand more of the
concepts needed for this project.
- Some of the obstacles that are in the way have todo with me just not being fully aware of what certian things do in the
code. Reseach will help with this.

### Stand-Up Meeting Two (11/1/2022)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Nic Ingerson

- Since the last stand-up meeting, I have done research into how SheetShuttle currently communicates with GitHub Classroom and Google Sheets.
- Before our next meeting, I plan to
- Currently, finding a way to pull the Google Sheet directly as opposed to using the downloaded sheet is the greatest challenge that I have faced.

Brock Brumfield

- More research has been done on looking into the source code, and have gotten a better understanding of what the file is
doing. We know what files that needed to be added and worked on.
- Before the next meeting I will work on getting information put directly to google sheets automatically
- Some obstacles are not knowing fully how todo this task yet. Researching and using the sources aroud me will help figure
this out.

Bill Ochieng

-> Since the last meeting, we have been able to create prs and add stuff to our repo and we keeping adding to the file and about add some code and some debugging
-> Before our next meeting, I plan to add some code to our repo and start debugging it as we continue working on the project.

### Stand-Up Meeting Three (11/3/2022)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Nic Ingerson

- Since the last meeting, I have worked with Brock doing research into the source code and understanding its functionality.
- I will continue to research and implement functionality to push directly from Google Sheets before our next meeting.
- With the task ahead of us, the main obstacle in our way is understanding fully how we implement what we need to implement for this plugin to work.

Brock Brumfield

- More research has been done on looking into the source code, and have gotten a better understanding of what the file is
doing. We know what files that needed to be added and worked on.
- Before the next meeting I will work on getting information put directly to google sheets automatically
- Some obstacles are not knowing fully how todo this task yet. Researching and using the sources aroud me will help figure
this out.

Bill Ochieng

- Since the last meeting i've worked on sheet shuttle and still is in progress running and working with it. I will continue to look at the plug in and see how we are to implement it.

### Stand-Up Meeting Four (11/5/2022)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Nic Ingerson

- Since the last stand-up meeting, I have found a tutorial on how to connect to Google Sheets using Python. I have a sample quickstart file in place that allows us to pull information from a Sheet based on an input Sheets ID.
- Before the next meeting, I will work with how to adapt this to our planned implementation.
- General lack of knowledge about how to communicate over the web using Python is about the only obstacle in my way at this point in time.

Brock Brumfield

- Since last meeting, I was able to do research on APi documentation, still need todo more. Files have been added to the
sample data folder.
- Before the next meeting, I will try to get a better understanding of what all needs to be done to implement the API
function for this project.
- The obstacles standing in my way are lack of knowledge surrounding API's and how they function. Research will be done on
this.

- I am yet to make any progress with my previous issue and i am still working on it trying to work out the implementation. I should have this done before the next meeting hopefully so that i can create a new issue and tackle it.

### Stand-Up Meeting Five (11/7/2022)

- What did you do since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Nic Ingerson

- Since the last meeting, I was able to do research on web communication with Python, though I am unable to fully understand it.
- Because of my inability to fully comprehend web communication in Python, I will continue to research and report my findings to my team.
- Besides what has already been illustrated, there are no obstacles standing in my way currently.

Brock Brumfield

- Since the last meeting, I have a better understanding of API functionality, and looked a little bit into how google sheets can be converted to a markdown file.
- Before the next meeting, I will look more into converting something from google sheets into a mark down file.
- An obstacle would be not understanding the full process of how google sheets is being pulled and converted, I will need to look for resources to help find info on this.

Bill Ochieng

- I have been able to run sheet shuttle i have started creating a plug in and pr should be up and ready for review from the technical leaders.
The challenge is now how to implement the plug in together with sheet shuttle something i am still looking into and planning to schedule office hours for.

## Sprint Review and Retrospective

### Sprint review

Which tasks were finished and which were not? For the tasks that were not completed, explain why not.

### Summary of sprint retrospective

How did you do as a team? What team strategies will you continue to employ? How can you, as a team, improve in the next project?

Most of the tasks were finished. We still need to convert what is on the google sheets into its own markdown file, but we
were able to implement functionality to pull data directly from Google Sheets, and integrate Grade Alert functionality of
pushing individual Grades to Gradebooks into SheetShuttle.

### Summary of sprint retrospective

How did you do as a team? What team strategies will you continue to employ? How can you, as a team, improve in the next
project?

As a team we worked well together, we were able to assign different tasks to different people and do a lot of research and
get the issues that had been given out complete. We will continue to assign tasks to people and post it on github so it is
made public to see for all of us, that way we will be able to hold each other accountable. We need to be more efficient in
terms of communication, we kinda lacked communication, rather it be not enough people respond to discord messages, or we
struggle to get a meeting time picked out.

- Second task
- Third task

## After completing this sprint of the project, what is a task that you want to practice more? Why?

Please provide a response to this question.

A task that we need to practice more is moving pulling something directly from google sheets. With more knowledge on this, it can only help in terms of this project, and for future work.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

Please provide a response to this question.

After all has been finished with this sprint, I would like to look into a task that has to deal with how to pull data
directly from google sheets. I would like to look more into this because I find it interesting how it is pulled and want to
understand it more as we move forward with the next sprint.

## After completing this assignment, what is your biggest concern about team-based software engineering?

The biggest concern moving forward with team-based engineering is the communication. If we will be able to communicate
regularly, we will be able to get more work done and meet more often to discuss what else needs to be handled, compared to
struggling to communicate and finding times when we are all available.
