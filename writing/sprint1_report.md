## Sprint Planning

Overall, each member plans to spend about 8-10 hours each week on this project; including about 4.5 hours of class time, an hour for completing practicals, as well as our team meetings. For the first sprint, we plan to spend the majority of our remaining time developing an example plugin. Specifically, we will be doing research into how SheetShuttle currently interacts with Google Sheets and pulls the information. This will allow us to learn more about how we will connect the information to GitHub. We will also be talking with the Computer Science department faculty about how GitHub connectivity in code will work, how it fetches data, how we would maintain the plugin, how we will deploy to GitHub, how to run tests for this program (if we need to in the first place), whether the code should utilize a csv file.

## Scrum Meetings

Please provide answers to the three stand-up meeting questions from each team member.

### Stand-Up Meeting One (10/27/2022)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Nic Ingerson

- As there was no previous meeting, no tasks have been done yet; however, I have looked into the source code for SheetShuttle to see how we may need to utilize it in our plugin.
- Before our next meeting, I will be doing research into how SheetShuttle communicates with Google Sheets and determine whether we can use a similar approach to communicate with GitHub Classroom.
- Currently, there are no obstacles in my way.

Bill Ochieng

-> I was looking at how the grading tool that is almost similar to how our project works and this was prompting me to have a meeting with one other member of our group, where we met with the faculty that owns the grading tool and just got an insight of how the functionality of his tool works and the meeting was helpful, opening our eyes to different approaches to our task.
-> As I prepare for the next meeting i'm diving into sheet shuttle and trying to see how we can implement a plug in a markdown.
-> Scheduling a meeting with Noor, just for office hours in places where I feel I have a challenge.

- Currently, finding a way to pull the Google Sheet directly as opposed to using the downloaded sheet is the greatest challenge that I have faced.

Bill Ochieng

-> Since the last meeting, we have been able to create prs and add stuff to our repo and we keeping adding to the file and about add some code and some debugging
-> Before our next meeting, I plan to add some code to our repo and start debugging it as we continue working on the project.
