# Report on Project 2 Sprint 1

## Reflection by Brock Brumfield, Aveet Desai, Nic Ingerson, and Bill Ochieng

## Did you follow the code of conduct during the completion of this project?

Yes!

- Nic Ingerson
- Bill Ochieng
- Brock Brumfield

## Sprint Planning

During this sprint, we plan to implement functionality to pull information out of the Google Sheet and convert it into a markdown file. We will then finish the surrounding tasks including writing documentation with an accompanying website, writing test cases, and creating a GitHub Actions.

## Scrum Meetings

### Stand-Up Meeting One (11/28/2022)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Nic Ingerson

- There was no meeting before this, but since the last sprint, I have worked out a final goal for this sprint.
- Before the next meeting, I will look into how to convert a sheet directly into a markdown file without the need to convert to a CSV first.
- Currently, the sheet conversion is the biggest challenge we are facing right now.

Brock Brumfield

- There was not a meeting prior to this one. Since the last sprint, a lot of sheetshuttles code has been looked at and understood. With this we can see what code will be applicable to use for our project.
- Before the next meeting, continue to look at sheetshuttle code and try to see if any other files other than the sheetcollector file has code that can be used as an outline for our project.
- The biggest obstacle in they way right now is understanding what all is applicable between the files being looked at in sheetshuttle for the grades.

Bill Ochieng

I have been looking into GatorEducator and trying to use their approach to read and write to markdown. My task for this week is much more on researching and looking into how to approach the task, hopefully i crack this soon so that i can get beck to debugging. I have also been trying to reach out to Noor and schedule office hours just to try and tackle this challenge.

### Stand-Up Meeting Two (11/29/2022)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Brock Brumfield

- Since the last meeting, not too much progress has been made. Still reading through some files trying to see what code could help advance us towards the finish.
- Before the next meeting, more notes to be taken on comprehending the code and bounce ideas off of the group to see what all could be applicable to our project.
- Obstacles that stand in they way are converting spreadsheets into a mardownfile and be able to push individually.

Bill Ochieng

I am yet to find a time that Noor is available to schedule a meeting and try ask for some insight. Other than that still on the research stage and trying to come up with different approach on how to access these directories and files using our plug in. Hopefully this gets figured out before the end of the week so that we can start looking at the api referencing website using Mk Docs.

Nic Ingerson

- Since the last meeting, I read through the functions of SheetShuttle and wrote down how they can be used with our plugin.
- Before the next meeting, I will be writing down some questions about the plugin for Noor. These will include some clarifications about how the plugin should work and how we can write code to do what needs to be done.
- The biggest obstacle in our way currently is trying to make this program work with any given Google Sheet. All professors have different ways of creating their gradebooks, and it is very difficult to define regions based on headers.

### Stand-Up Meeting Three (12/2/2022)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Nic Ingerson

- Since the last meeting, I had questions for Noor to answer. We held a meeting with him to clear up anything, and I have notes written down.
- Before the next meeting, I will be working on implementing Noor's suggestions and move on from there.
- The greatest obstacle in my way right now is the fact that even Noor does not have an idea for how to implement certain features necessary for our plugin use. He brought up the automation problem; which is what SheetShuttle is built for. Automating the push to student repositories is nearly impossible unless each student's GitHub information is in the spreadsheet.

Brock Brumfield

- Since the last meeting, a meeting with Noor was held about the remaining questions on the project and what are our possible solutions.
- Before next meeting, we will be working with Noors feedback, as well as trying to get code to print the correct out put.
- Our big obstacle is that we do not have working code as of right now, we need to find a way to implement something that will be able to just print.

### Stand-Up Meeting Four (12/6/2022)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

Bill Ochieng



### Stand-Up Meeting Five (12/9/2022)

- What did you since last meeting?
- What will you do before the next meeting?
- Are there any obstacles in your way?

## Sprint Review and Retrospective

### Sprint review

In this sprint, we were able to provide functionality to extract each students' grades individually. However, we were unable to provide functionality for pushing to each repository when the spreadsheet is updated. This is because there is no way to unless the spreadsheet contains the students' GitHub usernames.
