Nic Ingerson
- There was no meeting before this, but since the last sprint, I have worked out a final goal for this sprint.
- Before the next meeting, I will look into how to convert a sheet directly into a markdown file without the need to convert to a CSV first.
- Currently, the sheet conversion is the biggest challenge we are facing right now.
